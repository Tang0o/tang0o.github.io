# 🎉 Muhammed Arham's 3rd Birthday Invitation

An interactive, responsive web-based birthday invitation featuring audio effects, animations, and personalized content.

## 📋 Overview

This project is a custom-designed digital birthday invitation for Muhammed Arham's 3rd birthday celebration. The webpage features an engaging, child-friendly design with interactive elements, sound effects, and a beautiful blue color theme reflecting the birthday boy's preferences.

### 💡 Project Story

After over 6 years of transitioning into a Product Management role from being a full-stack developer, I realized I wanted to create something truly special for my son's 3rd birthday. While I've successfully designed invitations for his 1st and 2nd birthdays using Illustrator and Canva, I felt compelled to brush up my HTML and JavaScript skills and build something interactive and meaningful from scratch.

This project represents a nostalgic return to hands-on development—combining my passion for creating delightful user experiences with the joy of celebrating my son's milestone. It's been years since I've written production-ready HTML and JavaScript, and this has been a wonderful reminder of why I fell in love with web development in the first place.
